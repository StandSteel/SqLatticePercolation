# cluster cannot be found using cluster id after merging.
 because when two cluster becomes one cluster one of them looses it's own id and get a common id.
 In function SitePercolation_ps_v4::put_values_to_the_cluster()



# spanning probability




# using _cluster_index_from_id std::map to keep track of cluster id and cluster index
when merging two cluster, first erase previous keys from _cluster_index_from_id if it is the merging cluster
then assign new key and value to _cluster_index_from_id

# instead of erasing one site (that is placed) each time. randomize the site placing order then use that order
    to place site. This way we can minimize erasing one site each time.

# Vertical spanning (horizontal periodicity is not considered)

1. select a x_ -> i
2. find active site_index_sequence with specific cluster id or group id
3. If there are more than one active site_index_sequence with same group id ... todo
4. If there are one site (initially), find if it is connected to next vertical site
5. If not -> no spanning -> return
6. Else -> select this x_ and find all active site_index_sequence of same group id in this x_
7. Find all the site_index_sequence are connected to next x_ active site_index_sequence (vertically) with same group id
8. How many of them are connected (without horizontal periodicity) to the pivot site (which site is the connection_v1 to
    previous x_) take only those site_index_sequence into account.
9. If there are no such site_index_sequence -> no spanning -> return
10. If there is -> continue the process

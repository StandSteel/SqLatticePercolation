# Vertical spanning (horizontal periodicity is not considered)

1. select a x_ -> i
2. find active sites with specific cluster id or group id
3. If there are more than one active sites with same group id ... todo
4. If there are one site (initially), find if it is connected to next vertical site
5. If not -> no spanning -> return
6. Else -> select this x_ and find all active sites of same group id in this x_
7. Find all the sites are connected to next x_ active sites (vertically) with same group id
8. How many of them are connected (without horizontal periodicity) to the pivot site (which site is the connection_v1 to
    previous x_) take only those sites into account.
9. If there are no such sites -> no spanning -> return
10. If there is -> continue the process

Data file format
1. data file should start with a header

2. from which line data starts should be recorded in the header

3. attributes should be present on the header as a key-value pair, for example
	signature	SitePercolation_v7
	file_signature  a_file
	version		7
	ensemble_size	100
	length		200
	data_line	20

4. here 
	"signature" indicates the program or class that generates that data.
	"file_signature" is the starting string of the current file and all
		 the file that is computed from the data of this file.
	"version" is the key and value is 7, i.e., the version of the program or class
	"ensemble_size" is the key and value is 100. this is the number of
		 independent realization 
	"length" is the key and value is 200. length of the lattice
	"data_line 20" -> data starts from line 20. if it is 0 it means the 
		first line, i.e., counting starts from zero

5. Any line that begins with a '#' is considered a comment and will not be
	recorded or computed

6. Header portion should start with "BEGIN_HEADER" word with no exception

7. Header portion should start with "END_HEADER" word with no exception

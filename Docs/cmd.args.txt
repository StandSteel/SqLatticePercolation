Percolation on a Square Lattice

Available Argument

-h      Help
-l      Length of the lattice. Default value is 5
-r      Range of length. No default value
-n      Ensemble size. Default value is 1
-i      Number of impure sites. Default value is 0
-m      only counted for explosive percolation. default value is 0
        0   ->  sum rule
        1   ->  product rule

-p      place sites for
            0   ->  Just place all the sites and printout the result in the commandline only once to see
                    what's going on there and how much time it requires.

            1   ->  Place sites until first spanning. Without periodicity.

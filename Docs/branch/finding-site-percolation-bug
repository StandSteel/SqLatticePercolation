There seems to be a bug in SitePercolation_ps_v9 or SitePercolation_ps_v10 program. Which affects all the subclasses,
e.g., RSBD L1 and L2.

exponents   old     new
alpha/nu    0.6799  0.6587
gamma/nu    0.6407  0.6468

Or is it because of Convolution program?
TODO:
    1. Revise SitePercolation_ps_v9 thoroughly : pending
    2. Revise SitePercolation_ps_v10 thoroughly : pending
    3.. Revise Convolution program thoroughly : pending
